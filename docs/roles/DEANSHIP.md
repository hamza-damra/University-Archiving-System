# Role Documentation: Deanship (ROLE_DEANSHIP)

## Role Scope
The **Deanship** role focuses on the academic governance and university-wide coordination of the archiving process. This role has access to data from all departments but typically lacks the technical system-management powers of the Admin.

## Primary Responsibilities
1. **Academic Planning**:
   - Create and manage **Academic Years** (e.g., 2024-2025).
   - Activate and configure **Semesters** (First, Second, Summer).
2. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Assign Professors to Courses for specific semesters.
   - Manage the association between courses and document requirements.
3. **Academic Oversight**:
   - Monitor submission progress across all university departments.
   - View recent activity and status distributions.
4. **Reporting**:
   - Generate and analyze system-wide reports on academic document compliance.
   - Access comprehensive dashboards showing performance metrics by department.

## Key Access Points
- **Academic Years**: Control the timeline of the archiving system.
- **Professors & Courses**: Interface for managing the university's academic staff and their teaching loads.
- **Reports**: High-level analytical view of archiving health across the university.

## Comparison to Admin
While the Admin manages *users* and *system health*, the Deanship manages *academic operations* and *academic cycles*.
