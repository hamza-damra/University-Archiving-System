  "product_overview": "The University Archiving System Admin Panel is a comprehensive web-based application designed to enable administrative users to manage university academic data efficiently. It supports management of users, departments, courses, course assignments, and report generation with role-based JWT authentication and department scoping. The admin panel includes both backend API endpoints and a rich frontend interface tailored for ROLE_ADMIN users, providing dashboards, CRUD operations, and robust data filtering and reporting capabilities.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Provide secure and role-based access to administrative functions using JWT authentication.",
    "Enable full management of users across roles including Admins, Deans, HODs, and Professors.",
    "Support CRUD operations for academic departments and courses with dependency checks.",
    "Allow assigning and unassigning courses to professors for specific semesters to keep academic records accurate.",
    "Present dashboard statistics and visual summaries for quick oversight of university archival data.",
    "Facilitate generation and export of reports based on multiple filters to support administrative analysis and decision-making.",
    "Ensure usability through a responsive and user-friendly frontend interface with support for light and dark themes and accessible navigation."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Secure JWT-based authentication requiring ROLE_ADMIN valid credentials.",
    "User Management with create, read, update, delete (soft delete) capabilities and pagination with filtering.",
    "Department Management including creation, viewing, updating, and safe deletion avoiding conflicts.",
    "Course Management featuring CRUD operations and filtering by department and dependencies checks.",
    "Course Assignment tools to assign/unassign courses to professors by semester with validation.",
    "Dashboard overview showing key statistics and charts reflecting the current academic year and semester.",
    "Report generation with flexible filtering options (academic year, semester, department) and export functionality.",
    "Frontend interface with tab navigation (Dashboard, Users, Departments, Courses, Reports), modals for forms, and responsive design.",
    "Comprehensive error handling, validation, and user feedback with toast notifications and confirmation dialogs.",
    "Support for light and dark mode themes with preferences saved in localStorage."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "Admin logs in using credentials; JWT token is validated and role checked for ADMIN privileges.",
    "Upon authentication, Admin lands on the Dashboard tab showing key statistics and charts summarizing academic data.",
    "Admin can navigate to Users tab to view, filter, create, edit, or deactivate users with real-time updates.",
    "Admin accesses Departments tab to manage academic departments, with ability to add new departments and edit or delete existing ones (if no dependencies).",
    "In Courses tab, Admin manages course catalogues, adding or modifying courses and enforcing constraints against deleting courses with active assignments.",
    "Admin uses Course Assignments to allocate courses to professors for specific semesters, ensuring accurate record-keeping.",
    "In Reports tab, Admin defines filters and generates reports to analyze submission statuses and department activities, with option to export.",
    "Throughout the UI, modals provide in-context forms and confirmation dialogs for CRUD actions, ensuring smooth user experience and preventing errors."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "All backend API endpoints require ROLE_ADMIN JWT authentication and reject unauthorized attempts.",
    "CRUD operations for users, departments, courses, and assignments must enforce data integrity and reject invalid input.",
    "UI forms implement front-end validation for required fields, email format, and duplication before submission.",
    "Dashboard statistics and reports must reflect filtered data accurately and update dynamically as filters change.",
    "Deletion actions prompt confirmation and prevent conflicts if dependencies exist (e.g., cannot delete department with associated users).",
    "Pagination, filtering, and search features work correctly and maintain performance on large datasets.",
    "Reports generate correctly with selected filters and export functionality produces valid PDF documents.",
    "UI displays appropriate loading states, success notifications, and detailed error messages for API failures.",
    "Theme toggle between light and dark modes functions properly with persistence across sessions.",
    "Authentication flows reject invalid or expired tokens and redirect unauthorized users to login page."
